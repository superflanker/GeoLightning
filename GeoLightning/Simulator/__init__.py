Event and Sensor Simulator
--------------------------

Summary
-------
Provides tools to generate synthetic sensor networks and atmospheric 
events (e.g., lightning strikes), simulating their spatio-temporal 
detection across the sensor array. Useful for testing and validation 
of localization algorithms.
