Constants for Atmospheric Event Geolocation
-------------------------------------------

This module defines global constants used in the simulation and estimation 
of atmospheric event locations. It includes physical constants, 
sensor-related noise parameters, spatial tolerances, and thresholds 
for spatiotemporal clustering and localization bounds.

Summary
--------
The constants defined in this module are used across multiple components
of the STELA pipeline and simulation tools. These include:
- Physical constants such as the average Earth radius and speed of light.
- Noise characteristics of detection systems (e.g., standard deviations).
- Spatial and temporal tolerances for clustering and validation.
- Thresholds for determining bounds and sensor coverage.

Notes
-----
This module is part of the activities of the discipline 
EELT 7019 - Applied Artificial Intelligence, Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR), Brazil.
