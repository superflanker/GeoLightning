Sensor Model
============

Sensor Model - Geolocation of Atmospheric Events

Summary
-------
This module defines the probabilistic detection model for atmospheric 
events by a distributed sensor network. It includes a function to compute 
the detection probability as a function of the distance between a sensor 
and an event, and a Monte Carlo-based simulation function to determine 
whether detection occurs.

The detection model is calibrated based on the StormDetector V2 device, 
and is suitable for simulating sparse and range-limited detection scenarios 
in lightning localization and similar geophysical applications.

    Compute the probability of detecting an atmospheric event 
    based on the distance to the sensor.

    This function models the detection likelihood based on a 
    linear decay of efficiency beyond a 120 km threshold. The 
    maximum probability is 96% and decreases linearly 
    as distance increases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance : np.float64
        Distance between the sensor and the event (in meters).

    Returns
    -------
    np.float64
        Detection probability (between 0 and 1).
